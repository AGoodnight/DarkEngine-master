Text Adventure
=================

This is the first attempt at making a text-based adventure game,

It is no where near completion, however the aim of this excercise was to find the ideal way to structure the application, I know nothing of standards, and so now that I have made something that defies all standards I will likley re-build this project from the ground up again with a new pool of knowledge, standards and resources.

I find it helpful to explore a coding language, and then dive into best practices, I believe innovation comes from thinking like no one else and a lot of failure.
